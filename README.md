### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
---
I am Farhan Fuad, software engineer from Dhaka, Bangladesh. I graduated from the University of Dhaka and have been in the industry since 2023.<br>
I have always been a fan of cool tech and cool gadgets from childhood. Starting with a radium filled glowing watch when I was a kid, it's fascinating how far I have already seen things evolving with just a couple of decades. It really makes me feel fortunate to live in an age where we cannot even predict the next cool tech 2 years ahead. It's truly a great time to be alive.<br>
My interest involves problem solving, among a few other things. Exploiting a problem to solve in an unconventional and hacky way makes me happy. I love fixing bugs in code that often challenge my knowledge. Why a theoretically working code won't work drives me crazy. I also have interest in cybersecurity and wish to try a relavent role someday. <br>
I also love finding and listening to music from a diverse genre and origin - from Indian classical to Pagan folk metal to Mongolian throat singing, all in. Love playing random tunes in my guitar. Love a good story that leaves you baffling. Lastly, my wish from life is to spend my time and effort on something that's meaningful and affects the life of people in a positive way - something that gives a little bit of meaning to my insignficant existence in this lonely ever expanding  universe.
